two regression lines

We have, 4x – 5y + 33 = 0 => y = 4x/5 + 33/5 --------------- (i)

And 20x – 9y – 107 = 0 => x = 9y/20 + 107/20 ------------- (ii)

Solving (i) and (ii) we get, mean of x = 13 and mean of y = 17.[Ans.] 

Second line is line of x on y x = (9/20) × 7 + (107/20) = 170/20 = 8.5 [Ans.] 

byx = r(σy/σx) => 4/5 = 0.6 × σy/3 [r = √(byx.bxy) = √{(4/5)(9/20)}= 0.6
=> σy = (4/5)(3/0.6) = 4 [Ans.]
